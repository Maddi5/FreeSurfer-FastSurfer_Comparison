	abstract = {The early identification of brain anatomy deviating from the normal pattern of growth and atrophy, such as in Alzheimer's disease (AD), has the potential to improve clinical outcomes through early intervention. Recently, Davatzikos et al. (2009) supported the hypothesis that pathologic atrophy in AD is an accelerated aging process, implying accelerated brain atrophy. In order to recognize faster brain atrophy, a model of healthy brain aging is needed first. Here, we introduce a framework for automatically and efficiently estimating the age of healthy subjects from their T1-weighted MRI scans using a kernel method for regression. This method was tested on over 650 healthy subjects, aged 19-86 years, and collected from four different scanners. Furthermore, the influence of various parameters on estimation accuracy was analyzed. Our age estimation framework included automatic preprocessing of the T1-weighted images, dimension reduction via principal component analysis, training of a relevance vector machine (RVM; Tipping, 2000) for regression, and finally estimating the age of the subjects from the test samples. The framework proved to be a reliable, scanner-independent, and efficient method for age estimation in healthy subjects, yielding a correlation of r = 0.92 between the estimated and the real age in the test samples and a mean absolute error of 5 years. The results indicated favorable performance of the RVM and identified the number of training samples as the critical factor for prediction accuracy. Applying the framework to people with mild AD resulted in a mean brain age gap estimate (BrainAGE) score of + 10 years. © 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This method proved to provide stable and reliable estimates of brain aging - even across different scanners. While investigating longitudinal changes in BrainAGE in about 400 elderly subjects, we discovered that patients with Alzheimer's disease and subjects who had converted to AD within 3 years showed accelerated brain atrophy by +6 years at baseline. An additional increase in BrainAGE accumulated to a score of about +9 years during follow-up. Accelerated brain aging was related to prospective cognitive decline and disease severity.

Within a homogeneous age sample there is a considerable variation in the extent of disease and functional impairment risk, revealing a need for valid biomarkers to aid in characterizing the complex aging processes. The identification of biomarkers is further complicated by the diversity of biological living situations, lifestyle activities and medical treatments. Thus, there has been no identification of a single biomarker or gold standard tool that can monitor successful or healthy aging. Within this short review the current knowledge of putative biomarkers is presented, focusing on their application to the major physiological mechanisms affected by the aging process including physical capability, nutritional status, body composition, endocrine and immune function.

	abstract = {Machine learning analysis of neuroimaging data can accurately predict chronological age in healthy people. Deviations from healthy brain ageing have been associated with cognitive impairment and disease. Here we sought to further establish the credentials of ‘brain-predicted age’ as a biomarker of individual differences in the brain ageing process, using a predictive modelling approach based on deep learning, and specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), and applied to both pre-processed and raw T1-weighted MRI data. Firstly, we aimed to demonstrate the accuracy of CNN brain-predicted age using a large dataset of healthy adults (N = 2001). Next, we sought to establish the heritability of brain-predicted age using a sample of monozygotic and dizygotic female twins (N = 62). Thirdly, we examined the test-retest and multi-centre reliability of brain-predicted age using two samples (within-scanner N = 20; between-scanner N = 11). CNN brain-predicted ages were generated and compared to a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) approach, on all datasets. Input data were grey matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumetric maps generated by Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) or raw data. CNN accurately predicted chronological age using GM (correlation between brain-predicted age and chronological age r = 0.96, mean absolute error [MAE] = 4.16 years) and raw (r = 0.94, MAE = 4.65 years) data. This was comparable to GPR brain-predicted age using GM data (r = 0.95, MAE = 4.66 years). Brain-predicted age was a heritable phenotype for all models and input data (h2 ≥ 0.5). Brain-predicted age showed high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.90–0.99). Multi-centre reliability was more variable within high ICCs for GM (0.83–0.96) and poor-moderate levels for WM and raw data (0.51–0.77). Brain-predicted age represents an accurate, highly reliable and genetically-influenced phenotype, that has potential to be used as a biomarker of brain ageing. Moreover, age predictions can be accurately generated on raw T1-MRI data, substantially reducing computation time for novel data, bringing the process closer to giving real-time information on brain health in clinical settings.},

	abstract = {Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) are more likely to experience earlier onset of multiple facets of physiological aging. This includes brain atrophy, beta amyloid deposition, cognitive decline, and Alzheimer's disease—factors indicative of brain aging. Here, we employed a machine learning approach, using structural neuroimaging data to predict age (i.e., brain-predicted age) in people with DS (N = 46) and typically developing controls (N = 30). Chronological age was then subtracted from brain-predicted age to generate a brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) score. DS participants also underwent [11C]-PiB positron emission tomography (PET) scans to index the levels of cerebral beta amyloid deposition, and cognitive assessment. Mean brain-PAD in DS participants’ was +2.49 years, significantly greater than controls (p < 0.001). The variability in brain-PAD was associated with the presence and the magnitude of PiB-binding and levels of cognitive performance. Our study indicates that DS is associated with premature structural brain aging, and that age-related alterations in brain structure are associated with individual differences in the rate of beta amyloid deposition and cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {Objective: To establish whether HIV disease is associated with abnormal levels of age-related brain atrophy, by estimating apparent brain age using neuroimaging and exploring whether these estimates related to HIV status, age, cognitive performance, and HIV-related clinical parameters. Methods: A large sample of virologically suppressed HIV-positive adults (n = 162, age 45-82 years) and highly comparable HIV-negative controls (n = 105) were recruited as part of the Comorbidity in Relation to AIDS (COBRA) collaboration. Using T1-weighted MRI scans, a machinelearning model of healthy brain aging was defined in an independent cohort (n = 2,001, aged 18- 90 years). Neuroimaging data from HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals were then used to estimate brain-predicted age; then brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD 5 brain-predicted brain age 2 chronological age) scores were calculated. Neuropsychological and clinical assessments were also carried out. Results: HIV-positive individuals had greater brain-PAD score (mean ± SD 2.15 ± 7.79 years) compared to HIV-negative individuals (20.87 ± 8.40 years; b = 3.48, p < 0.01). Increased brainPAD score was associated with decreased performance in multiple cognitive domains (information processing speed, executive function, memory) and general cognitive performance across all participants. Brain-PAD score was not associated with age, duration of HIV infection, or other HIV-related measures. Conclusion: Increased apparent brain aging, predicted using neuroimaging, was observed in HIV-positive adults, despite effective viral suppression. Furthermore, the magnitude of increased apparent brain aging related to cognitive deficits. However, predicted brain age difference did not correlate with chronological age or duration of HIV infection, suggesting that HIV disease may accentuate rather than accelerate brain aging.},

It is vital that we better understand individual differences in the brain ageing process; hence, techniques for making individualised predictions of brain ageing have been developed. We present evidence supporting the use of neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ as a biomarker of an individual's brain health. Increasingly, research is showing how brain disease or poor physical health negatively impacts brain age. Importantly, recent evidence shows that having an ‘older’-appearing brain relates to advanced physiological and cognitive ageing and the risk of mortality. We discuss controversies surrounding brain age and highlight emerging trends such as the use of multimodality neuroimaging and the employment of ‘deep learning’ methods. Brain age can be predicted in individuals based on neuroimaging data using machine learning approaches to model trajectories of healthy brain ageing. The predicted brain age for a new individual can differ from his or her chronological age; this difference appears to reflect advanced or delayed brain ageing. Brain age has been shown to relate to cognitive ageing and multiple aspects of physiological ageing and to predict the risk of neurodegenerative diseases and mortality in older adults. Various diseases, including HIV, schizophrenia, and diabetes, have been shown to make the brain appear older. Further, brain age is being used to identify possible protective or deleterious factors for brain health as people age. Brain age is being actively developed to combine multiple measures of brain structure and function, capturing increasing amounts of detail on the ageing brain.},

	abstract = {Age-associated disease and disability are placing a growing burden on society. However, ageing does not affect people uniformly. Hence, markers of the underlying biological ageing process are needed to help identify people at increased risk of age-associated physical and cognitive impairments and ultimately, death. Here, we present such a biomarker, 'brain-predicted age', derived using structural neuroimaging. Brain-predicted age was calculated using machine-learning analysis, trained on neuroimaging data from a large healthy reference sample (N=2001), then tested in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (N=669), to determine relationships with age-associated functional measures and mortality. Having a brain-predicted age indicative of an older-appearing brain was associated with: weaker grip strength, poorer lung function, slower walking speed, lower fluid intelligence, higher allostatic load and increased mortality risk. Furthermore, while combining brain-predicted age with grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid volumes (themselves strong predictors) not did improve mortality risk prediction, the combination of brain-predicted age and DNA-methylation-predicted age did. This indicates that neuroimaging and epigenetics measures of ageing can provide complementary data regarding health outcomes. Our study introduces a clinically-relevant neuroimaging ageing biomarker and demonstrates that combining distinct measurements of biological ageing further helps to determine risk of age-related deterioration and death.},

	abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a wide array of motor and non-motor symptoms. It remains unclear whether neurodegeneration in discrete loci gives rise to discrete symptoms, or whether network-wide atrophy gives rise to the unique behavioural and clinical profile associated with PD. Here we apply a data-driven strategy to isolate large-scale, multivariate associations between distributed atrophy patterns and clinical phenotypes in PD. In a sample of N = 229 de novo PD patients, we estimate disease-related atrophy using deformation based morphometry (DBM) of T1 weighted MR images. Using partial least squares (PLS), we identify a network of subcortical and cortical regions whose collective atrophy is associated with a clinical phenotype encompassing motor and non-motor features. Despite the relatively early stage of the disease in the sample, the atrophy pattern encompassed lower brainstem, substantia nigra, basal ganglia and cortical areas, consistent with the Braak hypothesis. In addition, individual variation in this putative atrophy network predicted longitudinal clinical progression in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Altogether, these results demonstrate a pleiotropic mapping between neurodegeneration and the clinical manifestations of PD, and that this mapping can be detected even in de novo patients.},

The main purposes of these studies are the investigation of subject-specific aging mechanisms and the development of accurate models for age prediction. Deviations between predicted and chronological age are known to occur in several neurodegenerative diseases; as a consequence, reaching higher levels of age prediction accuracy is of paramount importance to develop diagnostic tools. In this work, we propose a novel complex network model for brain based on segmenting T1-weighted MRI scans in rectangular boxes, called patches, and measuring pairwise similarities using Pearson's correlation to define a subject-specific network. We fed a deep neural network with nodal metrics, evaluating both the intensity and the uniformity of connections, to predict subjects' ages. Our model reaches high accuracies which compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches. We observe that the complex relationships involved in this brain description cannot be accurately modeled with standard machine learning approaches, such as Ridge and Lasso regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, instead a deep neural network has to be used.},

However, from the vast extent of possible ML algorithms, which one is the optimal model to predict the target variable? What are the hyperparameters for such a model? Given the plethora of possible answers to these questions, in the last years, automated ML (autoML) has been gaining attention. Here, we apply an autoML library called Tree-based Pipeline Optimisation Tool (TPOT) which uses a tree-based representation of ML pipelines and conducts a genetic programming-based approach to find the model and its hyperparameters that more closely predicts the subject's true age. To explore autoML and evaluate its efficacy within neuroimaging data sets, we chose a problem that has been the focus of previous extensive study: brain age prediction. Without any prior knowledge, TPOT was able to scan through the model space and create pipelines that outperformed the state-of-the-art accuracy for Freesurfer-based models using only thickness and volume information for anatomical structure. In particular, we compared the performance of TPOT (mean absolute error [MAE]: 4.612 ±.124 years) and a relevance vector regression (MAE 5.474 ±.140 years). TPOT also suggested interesting combinations of models that do not match the current most used models for brain prediction but generalise well to unseen data. AutoML showed promising results as a data-driven approach to find optimal models for neuroimaging applications.},

Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modeled in n = 2205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2∗, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI, and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n = 520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r = 0.78, mean absolute error = 3.55 years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly gray-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n = 14,701), significant associations with multimodality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p < 0.05). Multimodality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.},

In this work, we propose a novel approach based on complex networks using 1016 T1-weighted MRI brain scans (in the age range 7−64years). We introduce a structural connectivity model of the human brain: MRI scans are divided in rectangular boxes and Pearson's correlation is measured among them in order to obtain a complex network model. Brain connectivity is then characterized through few and easy-to-interpret centrality measures; finally, brain age is predicted by feeding a compact deep neural network. The proposed approach is accurate, robust and computationally efficient, despite the large and heterogeneous dataset used. Age prediction accuracy, in terms of correlation between predicted and actual age r=0.89and Mean Absolute Error MAE =2.19years, compares favorably with results from state-of-the-art approaches. On an independent test set including 262 subjects, whose scans were acquired with different scanners and protocols we found MAE =2.52. The only imaging analysis steps required in the proposed framework are brain extraction and linear registration, hence robust results are obtained with a low computational cost. In addition, the network model provides a novel insight on aging patterns within the brain and specific information about anatomical districts displaying relevant changes with aging.},

In this work we propose a fast and accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans, replicating FreeSurfer’s anatomical segmentation including surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole-brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network architecture incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor network performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and subcortical structures. Further, we perform fast cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by directly mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (in under 1 ​min) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1 ​h runtime). For sustainability of this approach we perform extensive validation: we assert high segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure generalizability and demonstrate increased test-retest reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in dementia.},

  abstract={Many machine learning methods used automatic segmentation pipelines as preprocessing steps for early Alzheimer's disease detection. Most of those pipelines were time-intensive. In this work, the results of the deep learning-based FastSurfer pipeline were compared   to the popular FreeSurfer pipeline. Those pipelines were used to extract volumetric features from Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans. The FastSurfer execution time was substantially smaller than the FreeSurfer execution time. Random forest models were trained based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and validated for an independent test set of this cohort and a subset of the external Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) data set. The experimental results showed, that models trained using the FastSurfer data set achieved similar results to the FreeSurfer models. Both, the FreeSurfer and the FastSurfer models to predict the conversion of Mild Cognitive Impaired subjects reached accuracies of 63.89 percentage for the independent ADNI test set.},
