# FreeSurfer-FastSurfer_Comparison

This repository contains the scripts to perform the analysis and the comparison between brain segmentations. The segmentations are the ones obtained from different software packages (FreeSurfer and FastSurfer), starting from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T1 scans. The aim is to provide an easy-to-use tool for comparing these segmentations. The comparison is performed on binary volumes extracted from the .mgz files. The results include common similarity metrics like Dice Similarity Coefficient, Jaccard Index, Volumetric Difference, and Hausdorff Distance, as well as visualizations of the differences slice by slice in each plane (axial, coronal and sagittal) and in a 3D volume. Bar plots and line plots are also generated to help users to easily identify the slices with the largest differences in the comparison.
